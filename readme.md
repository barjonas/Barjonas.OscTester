### OscTester
This is a simple .NET 5 console application which can listen to an OSC endpoint (usually a broadcast addess) and print what it gets to the console window. All messages go throuh nlog, which gives you the flexibility to log it to file however you like.

I wrote this because I couldn't find any application which did a good job of showing me how bundles, arrays and data types were organized. I'd love to hear how it came in useful to you.
